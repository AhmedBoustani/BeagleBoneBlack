# BeagleBoneBlack
There are many things that can be done using a board as powerful as BeagleBone Black. However, since it was for an introductory class to Embedded Systems, we decided to go for something challenging and rewarding. The idea is to use motor and sensor manipulation to build a small robot that runs on its own and changes course when faced in front of an obstacle.
